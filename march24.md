# Getting Started

## User Input

Sometimes, you want the user to input some information. The program can ask a question, and it will
wait for the user to type something in and hit `Enter`. This line of code...
```python
name = input('What is your name? ')
```
will assign whatever they user typed to the variable `name`. Try it. Then follow it with a print
command. Something like...
```python
print(f'{name} is a future coder.')
```
